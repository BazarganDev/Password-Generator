# Password_Generator02
Create a strong, secure password using Python

## About
The password is a combination of numbers, letters and punctuations. You can define the length of your password as you wish. You can use it to make strong passwords for your social media accounts, PC passwords and e.t.c. I set bunch of my variables uppercase to be constant and unchangable.

 This is a basic password generator and I'm sure there are lots of better password generator repositories you can find in Github.
