# Password-Generator
Create a password using Python

## Warning
Do not use this for security purposes. For security and cryptography, use `secrets` module => [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html?highlight=secrets#module-secrets)

## About
The password is 30 characters long and it is a combination of numbers, letters and punctuations. You can use it to make strong passwords for your social media accounts, PC passwords and e.t.c. I set all my variables uppercase to be constant and unchangable.

 This is a very basic password generator and I'm sure there are lots of better password generator repositories you can find in Github.
